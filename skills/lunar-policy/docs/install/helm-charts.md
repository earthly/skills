# Helm Charts

Deploying Lunar on Kubernetes using Helm is one of our recommended production
deployment options.

Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that simplifies deploying and managing
applications by using charts — pre-configured application resources. Using Helm
to deploy Lunar provides a streamlined way to manage configuration, upgrades,
and scaling in a Kubernetes environment.

Our Helm charts include sensible defaults and production-ready templates,
allowing you to get Lunar up and running quickly with support for customization
via `values.yaml`. This approach enables consistent, repeatable deployments
across environments and makes integration with your infrastructure easier.

Please see the [Helm Charts Repository](https://github.com/earthly/charts) to get started.
