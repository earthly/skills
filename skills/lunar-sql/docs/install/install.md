# Installing Lunar

Welcome to the Lunar installation guide.

This section contains step-by-step instructions for setting up:

- [Lunar Hub](hub.md) – the central coordination service
- [Lunar CLI](cli.md) – an admin and development CLI
- [Lunar CI Agent](agent.md) – a CI instrumentation agent
- [AI Skills](skills.md) – agent skills for building collectors and policies

Before diving in, browse the [100+ pre-built guardrails](https://earthly.dev/lunar/guardrails/) and [30+ integrations](https://earthly.dev/lunar/integrations/) available out of the box.
