# Catalog Views

```
catalog
catalog_latest
```

The `catalog` view provides a historical timeseries of catalog JSONs generated by running catalogers over time. Each row represents a catalog snapshot at a specific point in time.

A subset of this data is available in the `catalog_latest` view, which contains only the most recent catalog entry. The `catalog_latest` view is guaranteed to return at most one row.

## Schema

| Column | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `timestamp` | `TIMESTAMP` | When the catalog was generated |
| `catalog_json` | `JSON` | The complete catalog data in JSON format |

## Notes

* The catalog view contains the history of all catalogs generated by catalogers
* Each row represents a complete catalog snapshot at a specific point in time
* The catalog JSON contains the full inventory of components and their metadata. The format is defined on the [Catalog JSON](../key-concepts/catalog-json.md) page
* This view enables historical analysis of how the component landscape has changed over time
* The catalog_latest view is identical to the catalog view in structure, but only contains the single most recent catalog entry

## Usage examples

Get the most recent catalog entries:

```sql
SELECT timestamp, catalog_json
FROM catalog
ORDER BY timestamp DESC
LIMIT 5;
```
